# myteam-generator

In any workplace, we want to be able to show off our team members or provide some kind of structural model of a team. This team generator will allow any users to generate a HTML file to contain card info of a team. Cards will hold different info but will showcase their name, email, role, and other specific info depending on the role. Clicking on the respective members' email will have you sending emails quickly and also access to their Github if they have one.

## Installation

Please follow the link below and copy either the SSH or HTTP key to clone the repo in order to see what is driving the team generator. In the terminal, please install the Node Package Manager, Inquirer Package, and the Jest package. Please change the default script line in package.json to jest in order to see proper testing.
